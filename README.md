Dotfiles, for use with [homesick](https://github.com/technicalpickles/homesick)

### Prereqs (must be installed/initialized first)

* git (duh)
* oh-my-zsh
* RVM, Ruby
* vim

#### .zshrc.local

`.zshrc` will try to source this file if it exists. It's useful for things (like NVM) I may want to set up on one machine, but not all.
